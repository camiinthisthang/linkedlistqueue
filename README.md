# linkedlistqueue
This is a simple C++ program that implements a queue as a linked list. 
It has the methods enqueue which add a node to the end of a linked list, and dequeue which removes the first node from the list. 
There is also a print method which prints the list.

This is the code repo seen in my YouTube video, Linked Lists Made Easy - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tq5fJmoYod4&t=301s
